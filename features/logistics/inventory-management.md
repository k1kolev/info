# Inventory Management

## Overview

A huge number of businesses on the market earn their profit primarily (or solely) by **producing or purchasing and selling physical goods**. 
Examples of such goods include **raw materials used for production** and **finished products intended for sale**.  

To **handle** and **keep track** of their goods, companies like these use a tabular system of records called an **inventory**. 
The inventory helps them **collect**, **connect**, and **summarize the information** about all the physical materials and products they own, operate with, and sell.  

Businesses today control and track their inventories using **software for inventory management**.  

Your **@@name platform** comes with a built-in **Inventory Management System (IMS)**, deeply integrated with the rest of the platform's modules. 
The **IMS of @@name** enables you to stay in touch with every article your business has available, regardless of where it is, where it comes from, and where it will go.  

## Inventory management's purpose

> [!Definition]  
> **An inventory** is the **summarized collection** of all the available **tangible items and products** a company holds for **operational and business purposes**, such as **sale** or **internal use**.  

Companies working with inventories are all around us:  

* **Production and assembly plants** keep stocks of production materials and put them into manufacturing to make the products they sell. 
* **Distributors** buy from manufacturers (more often in bulk), transport the goods, and then offer them in smaller batches or combine various products in sets. 
* **Vendors** purchase these goods, and often consult the end customers before selling and shipping the ordered products to them. 
* **Repair shops and authorized dealers** purchase supplies of consumables and spare parts for installing and repairing various vehicles, machines, equipment, and appliances.  

If your company is involved in manufacturing, distribution, field services, retail, e-commerce, or a similar field, then operating an inventory is an **essential daily activity** of yours.  

The purpose of an Inventory Management System is to **track, monitor, and control** the company's inventory along with the flow of items **into a store**, **out of it**, and when transferring **between different stores**.  

Your business can enjoy a set of benefits from using **a comprehensive inventory management solution**:

Your inventory can include various kinds of items. 
Some examples can be:  

* Raw materials and finished products 
* Work-in-progress or semi-finished goods
* Purchased products for the purpose of resale

## Boosting customer loyalty and sales volume

Some of the most common ways customers purchase their products include:  

* Store purchases (offline purchasing) 
* E-commerce (fully online purchases)

## Accounting

IMS updates the inventory when quantities and costs change, and acts upon the accounting records in the system to apply all updates. 
In addition, the system is intended to trace the quantities and costs of the goods. 








**Available to promise or ATP** quantity represents the minimum quantity of a product that your company can offer to a customer and deliver it to that customer without making them wait longer than agreed due to falling short of stock.  

ATP is an inventory management tool for determining the part of the inventory that is available for offering and promising to other customers. 
These portions of the inventory that are already reserved for fulfilling previously placed customer orders are not counted towards ATP, even if they are on hand.  

## Why ATP Is a Crucial Tool for Any Business

Delivering a product before the agreed deadline is one of the most important abilities for any distributor, retailer, or any other supplier.  

When a customer places an order, they normally expect this order to be processed and delivered within a reasonable period. 
Failing to fulfill orders and deliver goods as promised, especially if happening repeatedly, is a sure reason for customers to turn away from one provider and move on to another, resulting in experiencing a reduction in sales volumes.  

Therefore, ATP plays a huge part in enabling you to hold up your end to the delivery agreements made between you and your customers. 
Utilizing a powerful ATP tool ensures your business can meet delivery deadlines and customer expectations by being punctual in product delivery.  

Furthermore, mastering ATP empowers your business to come up with a systematic and sustainable inventory management strategy. 
Such strategy allows you to make the appropriate plans and arrangements, and ultimately cut down order fulfillment and product delivery times.  

All these efforts, when applied properly, increase your company's capabilities for delivering as earlier as possible, making a positive impression on your customers. 
Maintaining healthy customer relationships improves your business's market presence and reputation, which paves the way for returning customers, as well as referrals to new customers.

ATP for product quantities can be grouped and sorted by enterprise companies, stores, dates, lots, and others.  

## How ATP Is Calculated

Calculating Available to promise quantities is based on the Projected available balance.  

Available to promise quantities for any given product are calculated for the present day and for any desired future date(s).  


> [!NOTE]
> **Available to promise** inventory quantities should NOT be mistaken for **Projected available balance**.  
> 
> Available to promise shows only this **inventory portion that remains physically available to offer for sale and delivery**, aside from fulfilling already placed customer orders or serving the company's own necessities.  
> 
> Projected available balance represents **the full inventory amount** that is expected to be physically at hand for any successive future period.  
> 
> Although close in meaning and related in implementation, the two terms still express different concepts.
