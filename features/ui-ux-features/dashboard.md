# Dashboard

## Overview

Oftentimes in today's business environment, we **take on many roles and responsibilities** and, respectively, **carry out all kinds of tasks and actions**. 
Many experts, managers, and creators are **adept to work in multiple areas, professional fields, and industries**.  

The comprehensiveness and scope of our work **requires our attention and eye for detail at so many places**. 
This can have us **going back and forth**, **navigating through** various modules, apps, and panels, **searching for** information and continuously **checking for** something.  

What if, instead of dashing raipidly through here and there, we had **a single location that greets us** everytime we access our business management platform?

Something that we can **personalize to suit it perfectly to every role we and our team members decide to take** for the projects and assignments we face ahead.  

The @@name platform has a definite answer to this with your **Dashboard**:
