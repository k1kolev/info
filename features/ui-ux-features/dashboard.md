# Dashboard

## Overview

Oftentimes in today's business environment, we **take on many roles and responsibilities**. 
Respectively, we **face all kinds of tasks and carry out various actions to accomplish them**. 
Many experts, managers, and creators are **adept to work in multiple areas, professional fields, and industries**.  

The comprehensiveness and scope of our work **requires our attention and eye for detail at so many places**. 
This can have us **going back and forth**, **navigating through** various modules, apps, and panels of our business software, **searching for** information and continuously **checking for** something.  

What if, instead of dashing rapidly through here and there, we had **a single location that greets us** every time we access our business management platform?  

A **spot that contains everything we need in a simple, yet effective form**, allowing us to **review the things that matter the most**, in a quick look. 
Something that we can **personalize to suit perfectly to every role we and our team members decide to take** for the projects and assignments we face ahead.  

This way we'll always know where to start from.  

The **@@name platform** has a definite answer to help you with this. 

Meet your **Dashboard**:

## Dashboard in @@name

**The Dashboard in @@name** is the one place in the system that **brings to your attention all the things necessary** to start your day and go through it winning at your business.  

The **Dashboard** enables you neatly organize and put together the apps and tools that you use on a daily basis, providing a quick glance at what captures your interest the most. 
Your **Dashboard** is **completely customizable** and can help you **build a digital home** hosting everything you regularly use for the role you have and work you do in your company:  

* **Calendar** - bringing an all-around view of all your engagements like meetings, appointments, and others in multiple types of views, such as a day, week, and month view, and even tiles summarizing your events for the current day and week. 
* **[To Do Tasks](~/features/my-apps/todo.md)** - providing a list of reminders for all those quick and simple actions you have to take, arranged by their state of completion. 
* **[Social Groups](~/features/my-apps/team-collaboration.md)** - combining intuitive means for team collaboration like chats, team calendars, group to dos, shared file management, and others. 
* **Timeline** - showing a line of events and documents someway involving you and your currently selected company you work in, such as scheduled meetings, sent offers, closed sales, issued invoices, and others. 
* **[Tiles](~/features/my-apps/tiles.md)** - previewing sets of records like the events for the current day and week, the customers of a given company, closed sales for the current year, products of a particular group, individual prices to a customer, or anything other, that can be loaded in a single tap while automatically applying the desired pre-saved filter combination for a specific purpose. 
* **Favorites** - listing specific items or objects that capture your interest for any reason like a particular document chain (an offer leading to a closed sale leading to an invoice) or a customer, supplier, dealer or other person or company, or anything and anyone other you work with. 
* **[Web View panels](~/features/ui-ux-features/web-view.md)** - enabling you to integrate a view of a website, giving you an opportunity to browse and use a website directly from your dashboard, such as a web app, a website, or even any place in your own @@name instance visualized within the dashboard of that same instance.  

Various other kinds of features, such as **accounting and sales analyses** for receiving quick insights, **multiple different views of your calendar and timeline** to perceive your commitments from another point of view, **your notifications** for taking a peek at what happened recently, and others add up to the **endless functionality of your Dashboard**.  

## Purpose and Application of the Dashboard in @@name

The **all-around Dashboard** in **@@name** is intended to **summarize all elements** of **your commitments and undertakings** in your work to **display them on a single, neatly arranged screen**.  

To do so, the **Dashboard** combines **a suite of tools and features** to **visualize all the data you constantly look at, access, and use** during your day. 
The **Dashboard** is **your one-stop solution** to:  

* **review snapshots that are of interest to you via your calendar, timeline, and task apps** - your personal appointments, the meetings you participate in, your to dos 
* **access any number of records present somewhere in the system via the tiles you set up** - for example, the details of your contacts, the leads that you put effort in to convert to paying customers, the current availabilities of items in your stores, the received and still-to-receive payments from your customers 
* **get to a specific item in a single tap** - a particular supplier of yours, a marketing campaign that is going on, or a sales target your company has set 
* **receive quick insights** - events that happened today or this week, showing what new has been going on in your company concerning you  

## App Integration Capabilities of Your Dashboard

Thanks to **the native integration capabilities of @@name**, each app you see in your Dashboard is just a window or a panel **visualizing in real time the actual app** that is running in its designated place in your system. 
This means **each time you act in some way through any app displayed on your Dashboard**, **your actions automatically take effect immediately in the app itself**.  

These examples can help **illustrate this concept in practice**:  

* **Creating a new meeting** or **changing the state of an existing one** through **the Calendar widget** shown on your **Dashboard** actually applies the changes **directly in your Calendar app**. 
* **Completing a to do** from your **Dashboard** marks it as accomplished **in your To Do app**.
* **Chatting** with your team or **sharing files** with them via your **Groups widget** displayed on your **Dashboard** happens **in your Groups app**.

This architecture of the @@name platform **eliminates the necessity for synchronization and the possibility for unsaved progress or any delays** - syncing simply becomes unnecessary when **everything happens immediately where it is supposed to**.
