# Roles and Role Management

## Overview

As a part of the modern business world, every one of your company's members plays an important role in your business. 
People accomplish various tasks and engage in different kinds of activities depending on the position they assume in their company.  

To recreate these particular details in your digital platform, @@name enables you to define a role suitable to every position in your company.  

Roles are a powerful tool for managing users in bulk within your @@name platform.  

## Batch user management via roles

@@name enables you to personalize the layout for each role to reflect the role's needs, access, requirements, tasks, habits, and best practices as closely as you desire. 
The new layout is automatically applied to all the users using the associated role.
