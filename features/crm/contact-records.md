# Personal and Company Records

## Overview

We communicate with a lot of people in the course of our daily work. 
Whether meeting them in person, having a call over the phone, exchanging emails, texting via chat, or attending an online video call or meeting - we are constantly socializing and putting effort into building stable relationships with others.  

Successful communication allows companies to develop a wider network for business and achieve a greater reach over the market.  

Every day, we communicate and exchange information with a huge number of people and companies around us. 
We associate every person and each organization with a lot of data. 
So, lots of people and businesses with lots of data for each of them means even more data for us to manage in total.  

In order to keep track of all the conversations with these people and companies, as well as the various types of data and details related to them, we have to process and store all this information in a crystal-clear, well-structured way.  

**@@name's CRM module** provides an integrated **Contact Management app** designed to help you with your contacts and their information. 
The app provides a full set of intuitive tools for even the most complex contact management.  

**Contact Management of @@name** allows you to **break down the huge chunks of data** about each contact into neatly organized sections, **arrange these data sections** for fast and easy review, and **combine all this information in a complete, single record** of the person or business.  

## Handling lots of information

With so many organizations and teams we interact with, contact management alone brings up many challenges. 
We will explore some of the most notable ones.  

* **Data integration**: Many organizations store the data about their contacts throughout various spreadsheets, emails, lists, and separate apps. 
Instead of scattering data across multiple, disparate apps and files, using an integrated platform allows you to store and manage all the information about your contacts in a single place. 
This helps your team find, retrieve, and review this information much more quickly, clearly, and productively.  

* **Accurate and complete data**: In order for contact data management to make sense, information must be as detailed and accurate as possible. 
Over time, people and businesses tend to change many of their details. 
Thus, if unattended, contact data can rapidly become outdated. 
In addition, duplicate records can arise. 
All these can cause confusion and lead to inconsistent or lost communication. 
Using a dedicated contact management app provides the means to maintain accurate contact information, update it the moment you learn about changes, identify duplicate data, and merge it in a clear and unified way.
Your business can benefit by practically terminating the risks of data loss, communication errors, or missed opportunities.
