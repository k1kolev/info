# Personal and Company Records

## Overview

We communicate with a lot of people in the course of our daily work. 
Now, our digital companions allow us to call, meet, and text anytime, anywhere, as frequently as we desire. 
Successful communication allows companies to **develop a wider network for business** and **achieve a greater market reach**.  

With the growth of a business comes **a growing number of contacts**, as well as **a growing number of communication channels**. 
Interactions with those contacts also tend to **become more sophisticated in nature**, adding in more details over time. 
So, lots of channels and touchpoints, lots of contacts, with lots of details - that sums up to quite an amount of information that your company has to manage in total.  

To keep track of all the conversations and details effectively, it is **crucial to process and store** all this information in a **unified, secure, crystal-clear, and well-structured way**.  

**@@name's CRM module** provides an integrated **Contact Management app** designed to help you with managing your contacts base and all their information in a centralized, confirmed, and trusted place. 
The app provides a full set of intuitive tools for even the most complex contact management tasks.  

## What is Contact Management

With so many organizations and teams we interact with, contact management alone brings up many challenges. 
@@name platform's CRM module provides you with a complete set of business tools for a seamless experience in managing contact information.  

**Contact Management of @@name** allows you to **break down the huge chunks of data** about each contact into neatly organized sections, **arrange these data sections** for fast and easy review, and **combine all this information in a complete, single record** of every person or business.  

Utilizing the CRM module's built-in Contact Management app equips your team with everything it needs to tackle all challenges on time and in scale, ultimately making your business a winner.  

Using a solution for **integrated**, **centralized**, and **comprehensive contact management** can go a long way toward successful communication with company teams, leads, customers, suppliers, sub-contractors, and partners.  

Oftentimes, companies tend to disperse all this data once across various spreadsheets, email lists, and apps, and once more through different departments, teams, and even personal accounts. 
However, maintaining the integrity, accuracy, privacy, security, and validity of contact data requires a solution that prevents spilling it around.  

## Why is proper contact management important

### Streaming all contact data into a single space

Many organizations store the data for their contacts throughout various spreadsheets, emails, lists, and separate apps. 
Scattering data across multiple, disparate apps and files is fortunately a thing of the past. 
Using the integrated @@name platform allows you to store and manage all the information about your contacts in a single place.  

This helps your business stay productive and competitive by bringing valuable benefits:  

* Find, retrieve, and review contact information much more quickly, clearly, and productively 
* Establish a single, company-wide, dedicated environment where all contact information is accessible to all company members who need it 
* Access the latest, real-time data that is kept up-to-date at all times

### Accurate, validated, and complete data

Over time, people and businesses tend to change many of their details. 
Thus, if unattended, contact data can rapidly become outdated. 
In addition, a mix of various departments where experienced and new employees work together can easily lead to duplicate records arising.  

Efficient and useful contact data management requires your teams to keep contact information as detailed and as accurate as possible. 

Using the dedicated contact management app of @@name's CRM module provides the means to:  

* Eliminate confusion, inconsistency, and delays in communication with people and businesses 
* Automatically validate the type and formats of contact details - such as phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and others 
* Maintain accurate contact information and update it the moment you learn about new changes 
* Identify duplicate data fast and merge it in a clear and unified way  

Your business can benefit by practically terminating the risks of data loss, communication errors, or missed opportunities, and enjoy a seamless communicational experience with teams and stakeholders.
