# Personal and Company Records

## Overview

We communicate with a lot of people in the course of our daily work. 
Now, our digital companions allow us to communicate even faster, longer, and more frequently than ever.  

Whether meeting our contacts in person, having a call over the phone, exchanging emails, texting via chat, or attending an online video call or meeting - we are constantly socializing and putting effort into creating stable relationships with others.  

Successful communication allows companies to develop a wider network for business and achieve a greater reach over their market.  

With the growth of a business comes a growing number of contacts, as well as a growing number of communication channels. 
Interactions with those contacts also tend to become more sophisticated in nature. 
It makes sense for your team members to look for ways to associate every person and organization with as many contact details as they can get their hands on. 
This way they are able to converse productively and conveniently, making sure they never miss an opportunity ahead.  

So, lots of channels and touchpoints, lots of contacts, with lots of data for them - that sums up to a huge amount of information that your company has to manage in total.  

Keeping track of all the conversations with people and companies that bring value to your business, as well as the various types of details related to them, makes it **crucial to process and store** all this information in a **secure, crystal-clear, well-structured way**.  

Using a solution for integrated, centralized, and comprehensive contact management can go a long way toward successful communication with company teams, leads, customers, suppliers, sub-contractors, and partners.

### Streaming all contact data into a single space

Many organizations store the data for their contacts throughout various spreadsheets, emails, lists, and separate apps. 
Scattering data across multiple, disparate apps and files is fortunately a thing of the past. 
Using the integrated @@name platform allows you to store and manage all the information about your contacts in a single place.  

This helps your business stay productive and competitive by bringing valuable benefits:

* Establish a single, company-wide, dedicated environment where all contact information is accessible to all company members who need it 
* Access the latest, real-time data that is kept up-to-date at all times

### Accurate, validated, and complete data

Over time, people and businesses tend to change many of their details. 
Thus, if unattended, contact data can rapidly become outdated. 
In addition, a mix of various departments where experienced and new employees work together can easily lead to duplicate records arising.  

Efficient and useful contact data management requires your teams to keep contact information as detailed and as accurate as possible. 

Using the dedicated contact management app of @@name's CRM module provides the means to:  

* Eliminate confusion, inconsistency, and delays in communication with people and businesses
